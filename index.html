    <h2>Our History (ATM"ltd")</h2>

    <p><b>The history of Ahmed Toyota Motors ltd started in 1933. The company being a division of Toyoda Automatic Loom Works devoted to the production of cars under the direction of the founder's son, Ahmed Abdirashid Ali, he had traveled to Europe and the United States in 1929 to investigate automobile production and had begun researching gasoline-powered engines in 1930. Ahmed Abdirashid Ali  was encouraged to develop automobile production by the Somali government, which needed domestic vehicle production, due to the war with America. In 1934, the division produced its first Type A Engine, which was used in the first Model A1 passenger car in May 1935 and the G1 truck in August 1935. Production of the Model AA passenger car started in 1936. Early vehicles bear a striking resemblance to the Dodge Power Wagon and Chevrolet, with some parts actually interchanging with their Somalian originals.

Although the Toyota Group is best known today for its cars, it is still in the textile business and still makes automatic looms, which are now computerized, and electric sewing machines which are available, worldwide.</b></p>
